# REFLECTION

## [cite_start]About Your Process [cite: 1]

### [cite_start]What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester? [cite: 2]

[cite_start]I believe that the "aha moment" came in waves[cite: 3]. [cite_start]When we started crafting prompts, I integrated it into my presentations in the classroom[cite: 3].

* [cite_start]My students would try to use some sort of AI to assist them with their Linux homework[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]This only created problems for them because they didn’t understand the answers and weren’t able to effectively implement them[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]This provided an opportunity to teach them about creating **roles** for their queries and setting **limitations** on the content used to narrow the answers down[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]Once this was put into practice, the answer they received to supplement the textbook and classroom instruction started to make sense to them[cite: 7].

[cite_start]The next moment came when I started using **Storybooks** to provide chapter reviews[cite: 8]. [cite_start]I was able to use several different character schemes, such as Roblox, anime, or The Simpsons[cite: 9]. [cite_start]When some of the students started asking for the links, I knew that something was working[cite: 10].

### Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. [cite_start]What did you do next? [cite: 11]

[cite_start]When you don’t know anything about the topic, you get useless answers[cite: 12]. [cite_start]I wanted to create a database with fast retrieval and Gemini suggested that I create a container running **Redis** container as a solution[cite: 13]. [cite_start]All I could say was, "MySQL and MariaDB I know, but what is Redis?"[cite: 14]. [cite_start]I ended up with a buzzword for a solution and had to reformat my question to ask which would be better, MySQL or MariaDB, for my issue[cite: 15].

### [cite_start]How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now? [cite: 16]

[cite_start]I started out with things like, "help me explain Linux permissions. Explain it like I don’t know anything about Linux"[cite: 17].

[cite_start]Now, I usually tell it to **assume a role**, give it a **specific task**, and then outline the **limitations** for the question[cite: 18].

> [cite_start]**Example of a modern prompt:** Acting as a seasoned educator and certified industry professional in Linux administration, help me explain to a group of high school students, how to use permission in a rpm-based Linux environment[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Use food analogies to make the point[cite: 20].

## [cite_start]About What You Learned [cite: 21]

### [cite_start]What's one thing you can do with AI now that you couldn't do in August? [cite: 22]

[cite_start]I use it to create **hands-on labs for Linux**[cite: 23]. [cite_start]I list the commands that I want the student to use, the objectives I want them to achieve, and a method to measure the results[cite: 24].

### [cite_start]What surprised you most about working with AI tools? [cite: 25]

[cite_start]I must put this in the context of how my students use it[cite: 26]. [cite_start]When they haven’t read the textbook or understand the lab environment, the students receive answers that **don’t work in our environment**[cite: 27]. [cite_start]I even had one tell me that a particular AI gave him all the wrong answers[cite: 28].

### [cite_start]What's something AI is genuinely bad at that you discovered firsthand? [cite: 29]

[cite_start]Rendering text in an image[cite: 30]. [cite_start]It sometimes generates weird strings of characters[cite: 30].

## [cite_start]About What's Next [cite: 31]

### [cite_start]How might you use AI tools in your other classes or your job? [cite: 32]

[cite_start]I will use it to make more labs and Storybooks[cite: 33].

### [cite_start]What would you tell a friend who's never used AI tools to help them get started? [cite: 34]

[cite_start]The first thing is to **just get started**[cite: 35]. [cite_start]Pick one AI and explore the features and practice writing good prompts[cite: 35]. [cite_start]The better you can articulate what you want, the better results you can get[cite: 36]. [cite_start]Also, do some **independent study** about the topic you are working on[cite: 37]. [cite_start]It makes you a more informed consumer of the results[cite: 38].

### [cite_start]Is there anything you want to learn more about after this course? [cite: 39]

[cite_start]Even though there were no prerequisites, I believe some should be put in place[cite: 40]. [cite_start]Students will gain more from the course if they know something about **HTML** and some sort of **scripting language**[cite: 41].

## [cite_start]Honest Assessment [cite: 42]

### [cite_start]On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel working with AI tools now versus when the semester started? [cite: 43] [cite_start]Why? [cite: 44]

[cite_start]I would say about a **7**[cite: 45]. [cite_start]There is always room for growth[cite: 45]. [cite_start]I might have to revise that down after I learn and use it more[cite: 46]. [cite_start]I also started listening to some podcasts and YouTube channels to complement this course[cite: 47]. [cite_start]I figured the more I know the better I can help others use AI[cite: 48].
