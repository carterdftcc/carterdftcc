## About Your Process

### What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester?

I believe that the "aha moment" came in waves. When we started crafting prompts, I integrated it into my presentations in the classroom.

* My students would try to use some sort of AI to assist them with their Linux homework.
* This only created problems for them because they didn’t understand the answers and weren’t able to effectively implement them.
* This provided an opportunity to teach them about creating **roles** for their queries and setting **limitations** on the content used to narrow the answers down.
* Once this was put into practice, the answer they received to supplement the textbook and classroom instruction started to make sense to them.

The next moment came when I started using **Storybooks** to provide chapter reviews. I was able to use several different character schemes, such as Roblox, anime, or The Simpsons. When some of the students started asking for the links, I knew that something was working.

### Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. What did you do next?

When you don’t know anything about the topic, you get useless answers. I wanted to create a database with fast retrieval and Gemini suggested that I create a container running **Redis** container as a solution. All I could say was, "MySQL and MariaDB I know, but what is Redis?". I ended up with a buzzword for a solution and had to reformat my question to ask which would be better, MySQL or MariaDB, for my issue.

### How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now?

I started out with things like, "help me explain Linux permissions. Explain it like I don’t know anything about Linux".

Now, I usually tell it to **assume a role**, give it a **specific task**, and then outline the **limitations** for the question.

> **Example of a modern prompt:** Acting as a seasoned educator and certified industry professional in Linux administration, help me explain to a group of high school students, how to use permission in a rpm-based Linux environment. Use food analogies to make the point.

## About What You Learned

### What's one thing you can do with AI now that you couldn't do in August?

I use it to create **hands-on labs for Linux**. I list the commands that I want the student to use, the objectives I want them to achieve, and a method to measure the results.

### What surprised you most about working with AI tools?

I must put this in the context of how my students use it. When they haven’t read the textbook or understand the lab environment, the students receive answers that **don’t work in our environment**. I even had one tell me that a particular AI gave him all the wrong answers.

### What's something AI is genuinely bad at that you discovered firsthand?

Rendering text in an image. It sometimes generates weird strings of characters.

## About What's Next

### How might you use AI tools in your other classes or your job?

I will use it to make more labs and Storybooks.

### What would you tell a friend who's never used AI tools to help them get started?

The first thing is to **just get started**. Pick one AI and explore the features and practice writing good prompts. The better you can articulate what you want, the better results you can get. Also, do some **independent study** about the topic you are working on. It makes you a more informed consumer of the results.

### Is there anything you want to learn more about after this course?

Even though there were no prerequisites, I believe some should be put in place. Students will gain more from the course if they know something about **HTML** and some sort of **scripting language**.

## Honest Assessment

### On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel working with AI tools now versus when the semester started? Why?

I would say about a **7**. There is always room for growth. I might have to revise that down after I learn and use it more. I also started listening to some podcasts and YouTube channels to complement this course. I figured the more I know the better I can help others use AI.
