## Version 1: Claude
- Works: I am able to ask questions and get responses
- Broken: I requires very specific wording in the questions. It doesn't like acronyms. I doesn't correct my spelling.
- Observations: I like the interface. I didn't have to do any additional things.

## Version 2: ChatGPT
- Works: I am able to ask questions and get responses.
- Broken: I requires very specific wording in the questions. It doesn't like acronyms. I doesn't correct my spelling.
- Observations: I an not a programmer and I didn't like the default colors. I guess I need to be very specific with the description of the user interface. I created a container in Podman Desktop to run this html code. This was the only way I knew how to test this. 

## Decision
I'm going with Claude. I don't need to create container Podman Desktop to run it. It is easier to update and I am more familiar with adding criteria in this interface. Claude is my code writer, while ChatGPT is my question answerer.
